# React Quiz

## Objective
A React learning experience based on the creation of a quiz interface that renders N number of questions from a .json file. The reactive types can be choosen by the user and determined by the json file. Up until now the type of reactives are:

**Single selection**
- Radio button
 - Dropdown
 
**Multiple selection**
 - Checkbox
 
Since the project follows an atomic design paradigm, other components are
- Pagination 
- Text: Headers and paragraphs
- Buttons

## Limitations

- This part of the quiz interface that only renders the created product and contains dummy data.
- The evaluation will consist in a 100 points if all answers are right divided between the number of questions.

## Next steps
### **Components**
- Results page
- Waiting animations
- Progress bar

### Other
